# A minimal DNN

This is a minimal implementation of a Deep Neural Network using [tflearn](http://tflearn.org)

## Usage

```
./dnn.py l  # learn
./dnn.py p  # predict
```

## data directory

The networks weights are already trained.
When running `dnn.py l` again, those weights gets overwritten by the new ones.
